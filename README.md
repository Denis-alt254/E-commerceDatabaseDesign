📦 Peer Group Assignment: E-commerce Database Design

🎯 Objective
This challenge is designed to help your team master the art of relational database design 🧠💾. You'll collaboratively build a robust database for an e-commerce platform, starting with an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and ending with a complete SQL schema.

🛠️ Instructions

1️⃣ Create an ERD ✍️

Identify and define all entities (tables) and their attributes.

Map out relationships: one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.

Clearly specify primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

Use tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, dbdiagram.io, or MySQL Workbench.

2️⃣ Plan the Data Flow 🔄

Design how data flows between tables and entities.

Discuss and document the architecture of your database.

Think critically about scalability and efficiency 🏗️

3️⃣ Group Collaboration 🤝

Collaborate on analysis, design, and implementation.

Ensure that every member understands the full system.

Encourage idea-sharing and active communication 💬

4️⃣ Submission 🚀

Create a public GitHub repository.

Upload your final ERD and the ecommerce.sql file.

Double-check that everything is accessible for review 🔍

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Group Collaboration Tips

Meet regularly and stay connected 👥

Use GitHub for version control and documentation 📘

Track progress, share updates, and solve issues together 🔧

Keep everyone in the loop throughout the project 🧭

📐 size_option	Lists specific size options (e.g., S, M, L, 42)

🧵 product_attribute	Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight)

📚 attribute_category	Groups attributes into categories (e.g., physical, technical)

🧪 attribute_type	Defines the data type of each attribute (e.g., text, number, boolean)
