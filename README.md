# Peer Group Assignment: E-commerce Database Design

# Objective
This challenge is designed to help your team master the art of relational database design ðŸ§ ðŸ’¾. You'll collaboratively build a robust database for an e-commerce platform, starting with an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and ending with a complete SQL schema.

# This project is for educational purposes only and is part of a peer group collaboration assignment.

## E-Commerce Database Design road map

Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements Workshop 
-Brainstorm & prioritize key features for the e-commerce platform.
-Define core entities (Products, Customers, Orders) and their relationships.
-Gather business rules & constraints to shape our database logic.

Phase 2: Crafting the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) 
-Design the ERDâ€”visualizing how everything connects.
-Assign keys (PKs & FKs) to ensure rock-solid relationships.
-Review with stakeholders to validate our design.

Phase 3: Database Blueprint (Schema Design) 
-Transform the ERD into a relational schemaâ€”tables, columns, and all!
-Normalize for efficiency (minimizing redundancy like pros).
-Set data types & constraints to keep data clean and consistent.

Phase 4: Bringing It to Life (Database Implementation) 
-Write SQL scripts to build the schema in our chosen DBMS.
-Optimize with indexes for lightning-fast queries.
-Load sample data to test-drive our creation.

Phase 5: Testing, Tuning & Launch Prep 
-Test rigorouslyâ€”data integrity, performance, and rule compliance.
-Fine-tune queries & structure based on real-world scenarios.
-Optimize for scalabilityâ€”because growth is the goal!
